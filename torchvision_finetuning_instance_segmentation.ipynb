    "\n",
    "The [torchvision reference scripts for training object detection, instance segmentation and person keypoint detection](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/v0.3.0/references/detection) allows for easily supporting adding new custom datasets.\n",
    "The dataset should inherit from the standard `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class, and implement `__len__` and `__getitem__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only specificity that we require is that the dataset `__getitem__` should return:\n",
    "\n",
    "* image: a PIL Image of size (H, W)\n",
    "* target: a dict containing the following fields\n",
    "    * `boxes` (`FloatTensor[N, 4]`): the coordinates of the `N` bounding boxes in `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` format, ranging from `0` to `W` and `0` to `H`\n",
    "    * `labels` (`Int64Tensor[N]`): the label for each bounding box\n",
    "    * `image_id` (`Int64Tensor[1]`): an image identifier. It should be unique between all the images in the dataset, and is used during evaluation\n",
    "    * `area` (`Tensor[N]`): The area of the bounding box. This is used during evaluation with the COCO metric, to separate the metric scores between small, medium and large boxes.\n",
    "    * `iscrowd` (`UInt8Tensor[N]`): instances with `iscrowd=True` will be ignored during evaluation.\n",
    "    * (optionally) `masks` (`UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]`): The segmentation masks for each one of the objects\n",
    "    * (optionally) `keypoints` (`FloatTensor[N, K, 3]`): For each one of the `N` objects, it contains the `K` keypoints in `[x, y, visibility]` format, defining the object. `visibility=0` means that the keypoint is not visible. Note that for data augmentation, the notion of flipping a keypoint is dependent on the data representation, and you should probably adapt `references/detection/transforms.py` for your new keypoint representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model returns the above methods, they will make it work for both training and evaluation, and will use the evaluation scripts from pycocotools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you want to use aspect ratio grouping during training (so that each batch only contains images with similar aspect ratio), then it is recommended to also implement a `get_height_and_width` method, which returns the height and the width of the image. If this method is not provided, we query all elements of the dataset via `__getitem__` , which loads the image in memory and is slower than if a custom method is provided.\n"
